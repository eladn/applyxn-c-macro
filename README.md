APPLYXn basically receives a macro name and a variable number of items, then applies the macro on each item one-by-one.
APPLYXn optionally receives additional arguments to pass to the applied macro.
The applied macro over each given argument gets the argument to work on, the additional shared parameter sent, and the number of this argument (its place in the given arguments list).
